Assumtions/decisions,

1. babel has been added with minification of the js files. normally I would rollup before hand to make one file but did not have the time.

2. css would also have ideally been minified 

3. increased styling within including dropdown and margins (+ custom font). Given additional plugins I would normally have had the images appear in a modal or a seperate page within an application as to not navigate the user away, but due to spec saying give a link that is what was delivered.

4. css was seperated into more seperated out files for controls, navigation etc.
